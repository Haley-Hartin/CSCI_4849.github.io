      <h4>I tested the conditions of using your pointer finger vs middle finger. For the experiment, I went through a GoFitts trial using my pointer finger. I then did it again using my middle finger. I had my boyfriend do the same thing, and I recorded the average throughput from each trial. Both Scott and I, were quicker using out pointer fingers.</h4>
